# TensorFlirt: Automate Your Swiping Adventure ðŸ¤–ðŸ’•

### Swiping is so last yearâ€”let the robots handle it!

TensorFlirt revolutionizes your dating app experience by training a neural network on your specific Tinder preferences and then automating the swiping process. 

> **Heads up!** ðŸš¨ Using TensorFlirt likely violates Tinder's terms of service. Proceed at your own risk!

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- **TensorFlow**: Make sure it's installed and running. GPU support enhances performance but isn't a must.
- **Virtual Environment**: Create and activate one. If this sounds daunting, TensorFlirt might be a tad advanced for you.
- **Dependencies**: Install all necessary packages with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### How to Use TensorFlirt

#### Authentication Token
First off, snag an `X-Auth-Token` from the Tinder web app by inspecting a request. Insert this token into a `.env` file in the project directory like so:
```plaintext
AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxx-xxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxx
```

#### Farm Images
To train your neural network, youâ€™ll need plenty of imagesâ€”about 2,000 should do the trick. Luckily, you can fetch these from Tinder's API in under an hour without hitting rate limits. Run:
```bash
$ python farm_photos.py
```
This script saves photos into `images/downloaded`, plus organizes them into subfolders for original photos, faces and full bodies, setting you up nicely for the next steps.
Original photos aren't required and consume a lot of space, so I might add a flag to disable downloading them in the future. 

The script will also save every profile it comes across in the `images/downloaded/users` directory. They can be read into a `User` class but I haven't implemented it either.

#### Classify Your Swipes
You need to manually swipeâ€”sort your photos into 'yes' or 'no' piles, which will be later used to train the neural net.

The photos are moved from the `downloaded` directory into `images\classified`. This means that farming and classifying can be done at the same time!
```bash
$ python classify_photos.py
```
Swipe with the left and right arrow keys, and undo with `ctrl + z`.

#### Train Your AI
Now, let the magic happen. This script *should* train and produce two models in the `model\` directory, one for faces and one for bodies.
It runs fairly quickly on a dedicated GPU, so CPU training might take a while but should be feasible.
```bash
$ python train.py
```
Tinker with the model settings if youâ€™re feeling brave. Aiming for about 0.75 accuracy usually works well in my experience.

#### Launch TensorFlirt
Let your AI take the reins:
```bash
$ python tensor_flirt.py
```
Watch as it finds matches for you. Now, if only it could help you move out of your mumâ€™s basement...

### Future Enhancements

Thereâ€™s plenty of room for improvement! A user interface to monitor and adjust the AI's decisions in real-time would be a great start. Also, introducing features like auto-messaging with an advanced language model could take your dating life to the next level!
